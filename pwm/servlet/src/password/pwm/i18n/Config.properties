Title_ConfigManager=PWM Configuration Manager
Display_ConfigManagerConfiguration=<p>Welcome to the PWM ConfigManager. PWM is in configuration mode, which means you can make changes to the running configuration directly through this page. Changes made in the configuration editor will be saved immediately, and PWM will automatically restart to have changes take effect.</p><p>The current configuration was loaded at %1%.  (Epoch %2%)</p>
Display_ConfigManagerNew=<p><b>Welcome to PWM.</b>  We hope you enjoy using this software.</p><p>For help, guidance and other resources please visit the <a href="%1%">PWM Project Page</a>.</p><p>PWM was not able to detect a pre-existing configuration and is now in new configuration mode.  Please begin configuring PWM by selecting a default template below.  If you decide to change your selection later, you can choose a different template at any time.</p>
Display_ConfigManagerRunning=<p><b>The configuration for this server has been locked.  However you can still edit the configuration.</b></p><p>For security reasons, to edit the configuration, you must upload (and then download) the <em>%1%</em> file.</p>
Display_ConfigManagerRunningEditor=Your modified configuration is currently in memory, but has not yet been saved.  Please choose an option below to continue.
Display_ConfigEditorLocales=<p>Edit the display fields presented to users. Whenever a single value is modified for a setting, all values for that setting will be used to override all default locale-specific values for that particular setting. Display keys not modified from the default will use the default display value of the current pwm defaults.</p><p>If your modifications are to correct missing non-english locale values, please consider sharing your translations with the <a href="%1%">PWM Project</a>.
